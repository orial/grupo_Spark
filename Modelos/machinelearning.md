the essential ingredients of which include combining Bayes’ theorem with 
an independence assumption on the features (this is the “naive” part).

For example, using word frequencies as features, this approach can accurately classify 
emails as spam, or whether a particular a piece of text was written by a specific author.  
In fact, with careful preprocessing, the algorithm is often competitive with more advanced methods, 
including support vector machines.
